- Improved sizes of the toolbar buttons and the text view
- Changed font size from body to subheadline in the textview (updated swiftpm package)
- Border colour changes dynamically if the textView is focused or not.
- Border corner radius changes dynamically if there is more than one line or the toolbar is in edit/reply mode
- Added handlebar and corner radius for the bottom sheet and improved spacing
